# Implementation of [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661), for Audio.

Idea is to be able to generate speech using GANs.
Project inspired from [keras-dcgan](https://github.com/jacobgil/keras-dcgan).

## Todo
- [x] GAN trained for generating/discriminating half second audios using data from [Librispeech corpus](http://www.openslr.org/12/) and MLP models.
- [ ] Refactor the above code
- [ ] Parametrize training (model arch params, hyperparams)
- [ ] Implement GA for passing and evaling various model archs
